## How to Set Up the Batch File Importer Script

1. **Download the Script**: Clone or download this GitHub repo to get the script file.
2. **Fire Up Fusion 360**: Open Fusion 360 and go to `Tools > Add-ins`.
3. **Add Script**: In the `Scripts and Add-Ins` dialog, click the green `+` button or choose "Add Script".
4. **Find the File**: Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the script and select it. 
  - I'd suggest moving the file to a better location than the Downloads folder.
5. **Run It**: After the script shows up in your add-ins list, hit the `Run` button.
6. **Check It**: You'll see a message box with the number of successful and failed imports.

### Note for Teams

- Stick the script in a shared folder (Google Drive / Dropbox) so the whole team can easily access it.
